# Good day Sir!

# Here is my technical exam

# -- Environment setup --
# I made an environment where in the frontend and the backend is in a separate folders
# to make it clean and more organized.


# -- Frontend --
# For the frontend I used the vueJs framework as well as javascript, axios for sending a request and some css for the designs

# I have decided to make the UI/UX as simple as possible since based on the
# requirements I only need to get the weather and places of a specific cities
# that is why I used a dropdown.

# I used some cards to display clearly the current weather, weather forecast for the following days
# and places.


# -- Backend --
# For the backend I used the laravel framework with the controller, service, repo, repo interface and trait
# for fetching the data from the external api.


# My code implementation is the best because I followed the rules and criteria like the OOP, SOLID and also
# my setup is not monolothic. I have maximize the use of the vueJS and Laravel to the extent of what the
# exam needs


# Thank you so much and have a great day.
